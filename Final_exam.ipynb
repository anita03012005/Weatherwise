I wrote a short outline first, then asked AI to critique alignment with input validation (Week 6) and the menu loop pattern (Week 5). I kept the scope small and used the course menu structure. When AI suggested extras, I constrained it back to basic exception handling and simple lists, which matched our labs.\n",

I forced the loop to accept only four options and printed a short hint if input was wrong. I used Defensive programming (Week 6) when removing tasks by checking for an empty list first, then verifying that the index was a digit and inside the valid range. These choices made my manual tests easier and reduced crashes during demos.\n",
